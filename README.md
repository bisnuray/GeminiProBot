## Getting Started üöÄ

To utilize Gemini Pro, configure your environment with the necessary API key and service account credentials. Follow these steps to get started:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher üêç
- Libraries: `aiogram==2.25.1`, `PIL`, `io`, `logging`, `google-generativeai` üìö
- Environment Variables: `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` üóùÔ∏è

1. Install the required dependencies, ensuring Python 3.9 or higher:

    ```bash
    pip install aiogram==2.25.1 Pillow google-generativeai
    ```

   Note: The `PIL` package is part of the `Pillow` library, which is a more up-to-date fork of PIL.

2. Create a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) service account and download the JSON key file. Follow these steps:

   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   - Navigate to the project where you want to create a service account.
   - In the left sidebar, click on the hamburger menu and select "IAM & Admin" > "Service accounts."
   - Click on "Create Service Account" at the top of the page.
   - Enter a name for the service account, choose a role (e.g., Project > Editor), and click "Continue."
   - Skip the "Grant users access to this service account" section and click "Done."
   - Locate the newly created service account in the list and click on the pencil icon to the right.
   - Navigate to the "Add Key" tab, choose JSON as the key type, and click "Create." Save the downloaded JSON file to a secure location.

3. Obtain a Google API key by following the link [here](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey).

4. Set the Google API key and the path to your service account credentials as environment variables:

    ```bash
    export GOOGLE_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
    export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/serviceaccount.json
    ```

   Replace `<your-api-key>` and `/path/to/serviceaccount.json` with your actual Google API key and the path to your service account JSON file, respectively.
